dropover-custom-scripts is a collection of useful custom scripts designed to enhance the functionality of Dropover for Mac (https://dropoverapp.com). These scripts allow you to perform various actions on files in the shelf, which will be easily accessible alongside other file actions within Dropover. 

These scripts are based on UNIX or Automator scripting languages and can be utilized both within the Dropover App and independently, depending on your needs and preferences.

1. Open Dropover App on your Mac.
2. Click on "Dropover" in the top menu and select "Preferences."
3. In the Preferences window, navigate to the "Advanced" tab.
4. Under "Manage Custom Scripts," click on the "+" button to add a new script.
5. Locate and select the desired script from your system.
6. Click "Open" to add the script to your Dropover App.
7. Your new custom script will now be available in the file actions menu within Dropover.
